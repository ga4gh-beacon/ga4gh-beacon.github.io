The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)
has developed into a major international organization to address the challenges of
data discovery in biomedical genomics. The <i>Beacon</i>
standard developed by GA4GH with technical support by the European bioinformatics orgabnization
ELIXIR and many international stakeholders has become a default for implementing
modern concepts of federated data discovery and access.<!--more-->

This presentation will provide an introduction into data federation in biomedical genomics
with emphasis on the use of the Beaconm protocol for genomic data discovery, together
with a general introduction into principles and mechanisms of genomics standards development by GA4GH.
