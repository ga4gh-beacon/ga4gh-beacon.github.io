In this seminar you will learn about Progentix, a large open resource in cancer
genomics focussing on curation and sharing of somatic copy number variation (CNV)
data as well as other resources and research topics of the _Theoretical Cytogenetics and Oncogenomics_
group at the University of Zucrich and teh Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.

The second part of the presentation will make a case why such resources cannot be
sufficient and introduce the approaches shepherded by the Global Alliance for Genomics
and Health (GA4GH)<!--more--> to address the challenges of
data discovery in biomedical genomics. Here, the presentation will provide an introduction
into data federation in biomedical genomics with emphasis on the use of the <i>Beacon</i>
protocol for genomic data discovery, together with a general introduction into principles and mechanisms of genomics standards development by GA4GH.
