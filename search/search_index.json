However, Beacon v2 data model is flexible allowing other structured records (e.g. imaging metadata) that align with Beacon v2 specification to be made discoverable as well.</p> Who is the Beacon v2 intended for? <p>It is designed for research institutions, hospitals, genomic data repositories, and organizations that handle large-scale biomedical data.</p> What is the difference between Beacon v1 and Beacon v2? <p>Beacon v1 enabled simple genomic queries with only boolean responses (yes/no). Beacon v2 expands functionality by supporting complex queries, additional data types (phenotypic, clinical, etc.), standardized authentication methods and aligns with other GA4GH standards.</p> Does beaconizing my data mean making it fully public? <p>No, data controllers can configure the access level to their data as being public, registered or controlled access. For more information, you can check Beacon Security and Beacon Configuration File pages.</p> Where can I find official documentation on Beacon? <p>You can visit the official Beacon documentation for technical specifications, guides, and examples (docs.genomebeacons.org). For implementation toolkits, please refer to the Deployment Guide page.</p> Can I contribute to the development of the Beacon v2 specification? <p>Beacon v2 is an open-source protocol and welcomes contributions from the community. Please refer to the Beacon v2 repository for creating any issues or discussions. Additionally, GA4GH Discovery Work Stream has established special task groups, called Beacon Scouts, that continue developing various aspects of the Beacon v2 protocol. Beacon Scouts are open to volunteer developers. Please find further information here and contact the Beacon managers upon interest.</p> Where to find the code for Beacon Network? <p>Beacon Network is a federated system connecting multiple Beacons for cross-institutional genomic queries. The open-source code for the Beacon Network is available on GitHub.</p> Is Beacon v2 suitable for data analysis? <p>Beacon v2 standard is primarily intended for data discovery and delivery and has been approved as such by the GA4GH.</p> Preparing Data for Beaconization Does Beacon v2 API pre-process data? <p>No, the users are responsible for ensuring that their datasets have passed quality control checks and are informative for the community.</p> What data schemas does Beacon v2 support? <p>Beacon v2 supports 7 different schemas for genomic and phenotypic data by default, following GA4GH standards: Cohorts, Datasets, Runs, Analysis, Individuals, Genomic variations and Biosamples. It is not mandatory to have all schemas. However, Beacon v2 is adaptable to various data models, such as (imaging) metadata or RNA expression data (see RNAget extension).</p> Which are the mandatory fields in the Beacon v2 schema? <p>The Beacon v2 specification is very permissive to allow data models of various complexity, and thus, very few fields are mandatory. As an example, the following fields are required for each entry type (information extracted in April 2025):    - Analyses: \u201cid\u201d, \u201canalysisDate\u201d and \u201cpipelineName\u201d   - Biosamples: \u201cid\u201d, \u201cbiosampleStatus\u201d and \u201csampleOriginType\u201d   - Cohorts: \u201cid\u201d, \u201cname\u201d and \u201ccohortType\u201d   - Datasets: \u201cid\u201d and \u201cname\u201d   - Individuals: \u201cid\u201d and \u201csex\u201d   - Runs: \u201cid\u201d, \u201cbiosampleId\u201d and \u201crunDate\u201d   Please see Beacon v2 specification for more details and updates.</p> How are pedigrees represented in Beacon v2? <p>Pedigree structure can be defined in the pedigree.json file. The pedigree can be represented either from the perspective of the proband and describing the whole pedigree structure, or from the perspective of another proband\u2019s pedigree member and representing only the relationship to the proband. Please refer to the documentation for more details. </p> Can I update my Beacon data after publishing? <p>Yes, you can update records data as needed while maintaining Beacon\u2019s data access policies. The beacon doesn't need to be redeployed if only records (data) have been modified but depending on the implementation, reindexing the database might be needed (like in B2PI).</p> Setting Up a Beacon Instance Do I need a dedicated server to run a Beacon? <p>No, you can run it on local servers, cloud environments, or dedicated instances.</p> How do I deploy Beacon in a production environment? <p>Use the Beacon PI version, which includes optimizations for performance and security.</p> Does the Beacon API support cloud deployment? <p>Yes, you can deploy it on any cloud environment that supports REST API queries and allows for database integration, which is necessary for deploying a beacon.</p> How do I validate that my Beacon is compliant with the Beacon v2 specification? <p>You can use the Beacon Verifier v2 tool to check data structure and compliance before deployment. However, Verifier v2 only checks the framework and the data model format, but not the semantics of each field. In other words, it does not validate the content of the data records.</p> How do I emulate Beacon v1 while supporting the v2 protocol? <p>The Beacon Framework describes the overall structure of the API requests, responses, parameters etc. One can implement e.g. a Boolean beacon (cf. the original protocol) without any use of the model, just by providing a well-formed JSON response upon a request very similar to the (pre-)v1 allele request.</p> How do I report a bug in the Beacon software? <p>Submit an issue on the Beacon GitHub repository.</p> Querying Data in a Beacon What types of queries can I run on a Beacon? <ul> <li>Variant queries (genomic variant presence)</li> <li>Data queries (phenotypic, clinical data)</li> <li>Complex queries (combining multiple filters)</li> </ul> What types of genomic variants are supported in Beacon queries? <p>Beacon v2.0 does not provide a mechanism to detect what types of genomic variant queries are supported by a given instance.</p> <p>Beacon had been originally designed to handle the \"simplest\" type of genomic variant queries in which a position, alternateBases (i.e. one or more base sequence of the variant at the position) and - sometimes optional - the reference sequence at this position (necessary e.g. for small deletions).</p> <p>Beacon v1.1 in principle supported \"bracketed\" queries and a variantType parameter (pointing to the VCF use) - see the current documentation  for details. However, the support &amp; interpretation was - and still is (2022-12-13) - left to implementers. Similar for Beacon Range Queries.</p> <p>However, the Beacon documentation provides information about use and expected interpretation of variantType values, specifically for copy number variations.</p> How can I add e.g. an age limit to a query for a disease? <p>Ages are queried as ISO8601 durations such as P65Y (i.e. 65 years) with a comparator (=, &lt;=, &gt; ...). However, the value needs an indication of what the duration refers to and resources may provide different ways to indicate this (as then shown in their /filtering_terms) endpoint).</p> <p>We recommend that all Beacon instances that support age queries support at minimum the syntax of age:&lt;=P65Y and map such values to the internal datapoint most relevant for the resource's context (in most cases probably corresponding to \"age at diagnosis\").</p> <p>However, different scenarios may be supported (e.g. EFO_0005056:&lt;=P1Y6M for an \"age at death\" scenario).</p> How can I handle haplotype queries &amp; representation in Beacon v2? <ul> <li>Queries: The Beacon framework currently (v2.0 and earlier) considers genomic variants to be allelic and does not support the query for multiple alleles or \"haplotype shorthand expressions\" (e.g. C,T).</li> <li>Workarounds: In case of a specific need for haplotype queries implementers of a given beacon with control of its data content in principle can extend their query model to support shorthand haplotype expressions, as long as they support the standard format, too. However, such an approach may be superseded or in conflict with future direct protocol support. An approach in line with the current protocol would be to query for one allelic variant with a record-level genomicVariation response, and then query the retrieved variants individually by their id in combination with the second allele.</li> <li>Variant representation: As with queries, the Beacon \"legacy\" format does not support haplotype representation but would represent each allelic variation separately. The same is true for the VRSified variant representation, which for v2.0 corresponds to VRS v1.2. However, draft versions of the VRS standard (will) address haplotype and genotype representations and will be adopted by Beacon v2.n after reaching a release state.</li> </ul> Can I use a graphical user interface to query a Beacon?? <p>Yes, the Beacon v2 Reference and Production Implementations include a graphical user interface (UI) that allows users to query data   without  needing to use a terminal or console. The UI simplifies the process, so users don\u2019t need to be familiar with the structure of Beacon v2 queries.</p> What response types does Beacon provide? <ul> <li>Boolean (Yes/No).</li> <li>Count (number of matches).</li> <li>Detailed JSON output.</li> </ul> How to respond if the filter hasn't been implemented? <p>A filter which does not exist should lead to \"no match\" response. There is no dedicated mechanism to disambiguate between a \"the filter is understood, but there is no hit for this particular query\" in contrast to \"no idea what this filter value means\". However, the /filtering_terms endpoint should provide all supported filters and this can be used to check the two possibilities if needed.</p> How to respond if the filter target has incomplete values? <p>For sparse data (e.g. a value being available only for a subset of samples; think about \"genetic sex\" not being available or disclosed in a subset of individuals), normally only the positive matches would be returned. Evaluation if what the base of these numbers would be can be achieved through discretionary queries (i.e. evaluating the alternative options) or through additional informational responses (e.g. adding the overall observation count of a filter value to the objects in the /filtering_terms response or aggregate information to a dataset response).</p> Does the Beacon protocol support Boolean expressions? <p>No (...but). Beacon queries as of v2 always assume a logical AND between query parameters and individual filters, i.e. all conditions have to be met. There is currently no support for Boolean expressions. However, a logical exception is the use of multiple filters for the same parameter, which a Beacon implementation should treat as a logical OR since they otherwise would fail in most instances. E.g. the query using NCIT:C3493 and NCIT:C2926 (mapped against biosample.histological_diagnosis.id) would match both Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma (NCIT:C2926) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (NCIT:C3493), which are exclusive diagnoses.</p> My queries return \u201cNo\u201d, even when data exists. Why? <p>There might be various reasons. Please ensure the beacon is correctly configured, the data is available for querying, and it is properly indexed, and the queries match the schema format.</p> Why is my Beacon running slow? <p>Please make sure the implementation is developed using good standards and practices. If using a Reference/Production Implementation, then please make sure the server has enough memory and free CPU for optimized speed. Also, check the indexing of the database.</p> Security, Data Privacy &amp; Usage Policies What are the general security principles for Beacon? <p>An implementation of a Beacon must implement the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Beacon standard. The V2 standard has been approved by both the Regulatory and Ethics, and Data Security foundational workstreams.</p> <p>The Beacon uses a 3-tiered access model - anonymous, registered, and controlled access:</p> <ul> <li>A Beacon that supports anonymous access responds to queries irrespective of the source of the query.</li> <li>For a Beacon to respond to a query at the registered tier, the user must identify themselves to the Beacon, for example by using an ELIXIR identity.</li> <li>For a Beacon to respond to a controlled access query, the user must have applied for, and been granted access to, the Beacon (or data derived from one or more individuals within the Beacon) before sending the query. </li> </ul> <p>Note that a Beacon may contain datasets (or collections of individuals) whose data is only accessible at specified tiers within the Beacon. This tiered access model allows the owner or controller of a Beacon to determine which responses are returned to whom depending on the query and the user who is making the request, for example to ensure the response respects the consent under which the data were collected. The ELIXIR Beacon network supports Beacons which respond at different tiers, for example only Beacons which have a response to anonymous queries need respond to an anonymous request. </p> <p>As part of the ELIXIR 2019-21 Beacon Network Implementation Study deliverable D3.3 a document has been written to describe security best practice for users interested in deploying or running a Beacon or users who govern data hosted within a Beacon, and the requirements for adding the Beacon to the ELIXIR Beacon network. As the Beacon standard extends in V2 towards supporting phenotype and range queries, the tiered access model becomes more important to ensure the Beacon response is appropriate to the underlying data.</p> How is security actually implemented when I deploy a Beacon? <p>Security attributes are part of the Beacon v2 Framework. The file <code>beaconConfiguration.json</code> defines the schema of the JSON file that includes core aspects of a Beacon instance configuration. Its third section, called securityAttributes, defines the security.</p> <p>Check out the securityAttributes section on the Beacon Documentation website.</p> How does the Beacon maintain privacy and security? <p>The Beacon v2 protocol mandates the use of HTTPS (encryption) and allows user-defined securityLevels (public, registered or controlled) and response granularities (boolean, count, record).</p> Can I revoke access from certain users or organizations? <p>Yes, user permissions can be updated or revoked at any time.</p> How do I test a Beacon without having to go through complex security matters (yet)? <p>As a Beacon is designed to support data discoverability of controlled access datasets, it is recommended that synthetic or artificial data is used for testing and initial deployment of Beacon instances. The use of synthetic data for testing is important in that it ensures that the full functionality of a Beacon can be tested and / or demonstrated without risk of exposing data from individuals. In addition to testing or demonstrating a deployment, synthetic data should be used for development, for example adding new features. Additionally, these data can also be used to demonstrate the access levels and data governance procedures for loading data to a Beacon to build trust with data controllers or data access committees who may be considering loading data to a Beacon. An example dataset that contains chromosome specific vcf files is hosted at EGA under dataset accession EGAD00001006673. While this dataset requires a user to log in to get access, the EGA test user can access this dataset.</p> What authentication methods are available? <ul> <li>OIDC-based login (LifeScience, Keycloak, etc.)</li> <li>OAuth2 tokens for API access.</li> </ul> Can I allow anonymous access but restrict sensitive queries? <p>Yes, by defining public, registered and controlled access endpoints, and by configuring dataset/endpoint to return boolean/count response granularity.</p>"},{"location":"FAQ/#minimal-example-request","title":"Minimal Example Request","text":"<p>This example is for a minimal SNV-type variant query.</p> <pre><code>/beacon/g_variants/?referenceName=refseq:NC_000017.11&amp;start=7577120&amp;referenceBases=G&amp;alternateBases=A\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"FAQ/#example-boolean-response","title":"Example Boolean Response","text":"<p>In this minimal response to the query above, the beacon indicates that its default response is Boolean and that it could interpret it against the <code>genomicVariant</code> entity and in the context of the same Beacon version.</p> <p>In principle, one could launch a Beacon instance using the example response document as a template in whatever server environment one has at hand.

Originally implemented as a tool reporting the  existence of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) in aggregated genomic data  collections, the protocol has evolved towards more complex applications with  increased functionality. Implementations of the current Beacon API enable the  search for structural variants (e.g. deletions and duplications) and return  richer responses (e.g. variant metadata and call counts).</p> <p>With growing interest from the community in the implementation of the Beacon  protocol into resources and workflows, the next major release 2.0 will introduce  new features which were considered important by the community:  Queries by type: The Beacon will define different sets of attributes for  requests and responses depending on the type of query; e.g. a specific request  and response to return variants within a region in a chromosome  (wildcard/region queries) or to get a list of samples related to a phenotype,  provided the required authentication or authorization (see Access levels below). Filters: The next major version of Beacon will include a feature to filter the  matched variants by additional conditions on e.g. sample specific or technical information (e.g., associated phenotypes, assay type). Here the utilisation of ontologies will be encouraged, with alternative use of custom vocabularies for local applications. Schema versions: Given that new query types will return differing responses  (e.g., variant annotations, pointers to data delivery protocols), a mechanism will be implemented to reference internal or external data schemas that describe the content of the Beacon response (e.g., returning variant information using \u201cGA4GH Variant Representation v1\u201d). Access levels: Beacon administrators will be able to specify the level of access  (public, registered or controlled) for each field in the Beacon response and  even refine this definition by dataset, if these diverge from the default  values. This is applicable also to the query types supported (genomic variants, sample lists, etc...)</p>"},{"location":"news/2019/2019-10-21-beaconv2-ga4ghplenary/#author-list","title":"Author List:","text":"<ul> <li>Sabela de la Torre.

This problem needs even more attention since  genomics data sees an ever greater application in clinical settings, such as for medical diagnostic or prognostic purposes,  in rare diseases or cancer. Currently, most of the molecular analyses  generated in hospitals are not utilised for further research due to lack of proper tools for an interoperable and ethical sharing of the data. The Beacon project (ELIXIR, see also the Global Alliance in Health and Genomics for the standard) aims to alleviate the problem of genomics data sharing through enabling the search of genomic variants and associated information without jeopardising the privacy of the dataset. This way, any hospital or research entity can choose to 'beaconize' their dataset without compromising its privacy or ownership.</p> <p>With growing interest from the community in the implementation of the Beacon protocol into resources and workflows, the release 2.0 introduces new features considered important by the community: e.g. queries by entity type, filters, schema versions, and access levels. While both the research and the clinical community recognizes the value of these additions, practical implementation of the Beacon could still be a challenging task, especially for institutions with limited IT resources. The ELIXIR implementation studies (2019-2021; 2022-2024) aim to develop a reference implementation so researchers and clinicians can use it as an example to deploy their own Beacon without needing extensive knowledge on how to build an API.</p> <p>This workshop has two objectives, to provide participants with:</p> <p>1-  Demos and insights on Beacon implementations. For this objective we will invite early Beacon v2 implementers who provided valuable feedback to the specification and will share their use-cases and experiences: Michael Baudis (Progenetix), Tim Beck (Caf\u00e9 Variome), and Carles Hernandez (CNAG-CRG). </p> <p>2- A training session on how to d eploy a Beacon using the reference implementation. For this objective we will invite members of the European Genome-phenome Archive (Manuel Rueda) who support Beacon deployment in hospitals and clinical institutions and will provide a hands-on session. </p> <p>Beacon version 2 is a highly expected product in the genomics research and clinical communities. Now that the Beacon community has released a stable version, it is time to provide beacon implementers guidelines and resources to implement or deploy their own Beacons to foster data discovery and data re-use. </p>"},{"location":"news/2022/2022-06-07-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-and-BeaconPlus__ELIXIR-All-Hands/","title":"Progenetix & BeaconPlus - An open cancer genomics resource on a stack of Beacon code...","text":""},{"location":"news/2022/2022-06-07-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-and-BeaconPlus__ELIXIR-All-Hands/#michael-baudis","title":"Michael Baudis","text":"<p>Here Michael provides some overview of the multi-year trajectory of the Beacon API development, and how BeaconPlus &amp; Progenetix have been utilized for \"implementation driven design\".</p>"},{"location":"news/2022/2022-08-08-GA4GH-Plenary-2022/","title":"GA4GH 2022 \u2014 Beacon v2 standard highlighted at the GA4GH plenary","text":"<p>Jordi Rambla, one of the key Beacon v2 leaders, will present the Beacon v2 Specification in Barcelona for the Global Alliance for Genomics And Health (GA4GH) 10th Plenary Meeting. </p> CosmoCaixa building in Barcelona. <p>The 10th Plenary, which will be held from 22 to 23 September 2022 at the CosmoCaixa, will bring together organizations and stakeholders from the genomics and health community.</p> <p>The event will focus on genomic and clinical data sharing issues that pervade a diverse cross-section of industries, disciplines, and communities.</p> <p>For more information, please visit the official website of the Plenary Meeting.</p>","tags":["specification","development","events"]},{"location":"news/2022/2022-08-11-ECCB-Beacon-workshop/","title":"Beacon v2 will be at the European Conference on Computational Biology with a Workshop on tools and techniques to make sensitive data discoverable","text":"<p>The Workshop \"Tools and techniques to make sensitive data discoverable (Use-cases, hands-on session of Beacon implementation)\" will take place on September 15th, in the framework of the 21st European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB).

In the two years since the project\u2019s inception, over 90 Beacons have been lit by 35 organizations serving over 200 datasets. These datasets are searchable individually or in aggregate via the Beacon Network (beacon-network.org), a federated search engine across the world\u2019s public beacons. Beacons serve large, diverse, valuable collections of genomics datasets, showing the viability of a global federated model for genomics data discovery and sharing through a simple and securable technical protocol.

To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles. In this article, we report a 4.5-fold increase in sample number since 2013, improvements in data quality, ontology representation with a CNV landscape summary over 51 distinctive National Cancer Institute Thesaurus cancer terms as well as updates in database schemas, and data access including new web front-end and programmatic data access.</p> <p>Database URL: progenetix.org</p>"},{"location":"publications/2021-06-30-publication-Progenetix-2021/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"<p>The first version of the article had been posted at biorXiv on 2021-02-15.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2021-11-10-Cell-Genomics-GA4GH-VRS/","title":"The GA4GH Variation Representation Specification (VRS): a Computational Framework for the Precise Representation and Federated Identification of Molecular Variation.","text":""},{"location":"publications/2021-11-10-Cell-Genomics-GA4GH-VRS/#alex-h-wagner-lawrence-babb-gil-alterovitz-michael-baudis-matthew-brush-daniel-l-cameron-melissa-cline-malachi-griffith-obi-l-griffith-melissa-konopko-heidi-l-rehm-andrew-d-yates-robert-r-freimuth-reece-k-hart","title":"Alex H.

Phenotypic features (signs, symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, results of physiological tests, etc.) are of high clinical importance, yet exchanging them in conjunction with genomic variation information is often overlooked or even neglected. In the clinical domain, substantial work has been dedicated to the development of computational phenotypes. Traditionally, these approaches have largely relied on rule-based methods and large sources of clinical data to identify cohorts of patients with or without a specific disease. However, they were not developed to enable deep phenotyping of abnormalities, to facilitate computational analysis of interpatient phenotypic similarity or to support computational decision support. To address this, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health6 (GA4GH) has developed the Phenopacket schema, which supports the exchange of computable longitudinal case-level phenotypic information for diagnosis of, and research on, all types of disease, including Mendelian and complex genetic diseases, cancers and infectious diseases.

PLoS One. 18:e0285433.","text":"<p>Abstract The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) is a standards-setting organization that is developing a suite of coordinated standards for genomics. The GA4GH Phenopacket Schema is a standard for sharing disease and phenotype information that characterizes an individual person or biosample. The Phenopacket Schema is flexible and can represent clinical data for any kind of human disease including rare disease, complex disease, and cancer. It also allows consortia or databases to apply additional constraints to ensure uniform data collection for specific goals. We present phenopacket-tools, an open-source Java library and command-line application for construction, conversion, and validation of phenopackets. Phenopacket-tools simplifies construction of phenopackets by providing concise builders, programmatic shortcuts, and predefined building blocks (ontology classes) for concepts such as anatomical organs, age of onset, biospecimen type, and clinical modifiers. Phenopacket-tools can be used to validate the syntax and semantics of phenopackets as well as to assess adherence to additional user-defined requirements. The documentation includes examples showing how to use the Java library and the command-line tool to create and validate phenopackets. We demonstrate how to create, convert, and validate phenopackets using the library or the command-line application. Source code, API documentation, comprehensive user guide and a tutorial can be found at github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-tools. The library can be installed from the public Maven Central artifact repository and the application is available as a standalone archive. The phenopacket-tools library helps developers implement and standardize the collection and exchange of phenotypic and other clinical data for use in phenotype-driven genomic diagnostics, translational research, and precision medicine applications.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2024-03-01-Beacon-Tips/","title":"Twelve quick tips for deploying a Beacon","text":""},{"location":"publications/2024-03-01-Beacon-Tips/#lauren-a-fromont-mauricio-moldes-michael-baudis-anthony-j-brookes-arcadi-navarro-and-jordi-rambla","title":"Lauren A Fromont, Mauricio Moldes, Michael Baudis, Anthony J Brookes, Arcadi Navarro and Jordi Rambla","text":""},{"location":"publications/2024-03-01-Beacon-Tips/#plos-comput-biol-2024-mar-1203e1011817","title":"PLoS Comput Biol. 2024 Mar 1;20(3):e1011817.","text":"<ul> <li>doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011817.</li> <li>PMID: 38427629</li> </ul> <p>Introduction: In the age of data-driven biomedical research and clinical practice, the sharing of genomic and clinical data for health research and personalized medicine has become an important contribu- tor to improved diagnosis and treatment.

Genomic alterations in cancer cell lines are widely studied as models for oncogenetic events and are represented in a wide range of primary resources. We have created a comprehensive, curated knowledge resource - cancercelllines.org - with the aim to enable easy access to genomic profiling data in cancer cell lines, curated from a variety of resources and integrating both copy number and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) data. We have gathered over 5,600 copy number profiles as well as SNV annotations for 16,000 cell lines and provide this data with mappings to the GRCh38 reference genome. Both genomic variations and associated curated metadata can be queried through the GA4GH Beacon v2 API and a graphical user interface with extensive data retrieval enabled using GA4GH data schemas under a permissive licensing scheme.</p> <p>Availability and Implementation: Our resource is publicly available on the web at cancercelllines.org.</p>"},{"location":"publications/2025-03-23-pgxRpi/","title":"pgxRpi: an R/Bioconductor package for user-friendly access to the Beacon API","text":""},{"location":"publications/2025-03-23-pgxRpi/#hangjia-zhao-and-michael-baudis","title":"Hangjia Zhao and Michael Baudis","text":""},{"location":"publications/2025-03-23-pgxRpi/#bioinform-adv-2025-jul-1651vbaf172","title":"Bioinform Adv. 2025 Jul 16;5(1):vbaf172","text":"<ul> <li>doi: 10.1093/bioadv/vbaf172</li> <li>PMID: 40761325</li> </ul> <p>Abstract: The Beacon specification, established by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), consists of a standardized framework and data models for genomic and phenotypic data discovery. By enabling secure, federated data sharing, it fosters interoperability across genomic resources. Progenetix, a reference implementation of Beacon, exemplifies its potential for large-scale genomic data integration, offering open access to genomic mutation data across diverse cancer types. Here we present pgxRpi, an open-source R/Bioconductor package that provides a streamlined interface to the Progenetix Beacon REST API,  facilitating efficient and flexible genomic data retrieval. Beyond data access, pgxRpi offers integrated visualization and analysis functions, enabling users to explore, interpret, and process queried data effectively. Leveraging the flexibility of the Beacon standard, pgxRpi extends beyond Progenetix, supporting interoperable data access across multiple Beacon-enabled resources, thereby enhancing data-driven discovery in genomics.</p> <p>Availability and Implementation: pgxRpi is freely available under the Artistic-2.0 license from Bioconductor, with actively maintained source code on GitHub.
